# Pre-flight checks

## Mission

* Mission conforms with local laws and regulations.
* The mission was planned in accordance with the guidelines set forth in the [Plan section](planning-a-mission.md).
* The mission passed the [DeltaQuad Mission Validator](https://validator.deltaquad.com/)
* Altitudes verified across terrain height.
* The mission path is free of obstructions for at least 200 meters in each horizontal direction.
* VTOL Takeoff and VTOL Land items correctly applied.
* The takeoff location is free from obstructions at transition altitude for 500m in every direction.
* Takeoff and land site is clear of obstacles and structures higher than transition altitude.
* The path for takeoff and landing is set so that the vehicle points into the wind.

## Airframe

* The vehicle does not exceed the [scheduled maintenance](../maintenance/scheduled-maintenenance.md) or [preventive maintenance](../maintenance/preventive-maintenance.md) cycles.
* The airframe conforms with all local rules and regulations and is permitted to fly the intended mission.
* The propellers are mounted in the correct position, orientation and direction as specified in the [Assembly section](../setup/assembly.md).

Visual inspection for damage, dirt, correctly mounted and securely fastened:

* Propellers
* Motors
* Wings
* Servos
* Elevons
* Devices inside the fuselage
* Flight battery

## Before closing hatch

* When the vehicle sits outside, the hatch must not be closed until the vehicle is ready for takeoff as the components inside could overheat when sitting idle. Exposure to direct sunlight when idle for more than 5 minutes should be avoided.
* Flight battery - Securely attached, moved as far forward as possible, connector fully joined.
* Telemetry - Attached and working.
* SD-card installed.
* Aileron linkage - Properly secured without slop or play.
* Payload sits within the payload bay (center bay) and does not exceed 1.2kg.
* Components inside the fuselage are securely fastened and cannot move during flight.

## After closing hatch

* Hatch secured (unable to pull up)
* Hatch sits flush with the fuselage (no obstructions under the hatch legs)
* VTOL modules and wing joiners properly secured with lock clips down.

## Before takeoff

* Weather conditions and mission within[ tolerances](../vehicle-specifications.md).
* The vehicle is pointing into the wind.
* No warnings on GCS.
* The wing servos are powered (try to move the elevons and feel resistance from the servo).
* The vehicle's current physical orientation matches the heading observed on GCS.
* Battery capacity is sufficient for vehicle and ground equipment.
* [Safety features](../setup/safety-features.md) are set correctly.
* GPS lock is stable with at least 10 registered satellites.
* Mission uploaded and downloaded to verify.
* Takeoff waypoint is active (green)
