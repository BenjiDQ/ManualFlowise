All flight characteristics are based on optimized settings at sea level

\* These values assume 90% battery usage, low wind conditions and include a low altitude vertical takeoff and landing at sea level. EU Export versions are locked to 59 minutes flight time.

\*\* These values are based on measurements at flight altitude
