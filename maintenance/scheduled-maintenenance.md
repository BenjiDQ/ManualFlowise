# Scheduled maintenance

The recommended service cycle for the DeltaQuad UAV  12 months. Beyond this point the vehicle can fly less efficient and there could be a potential risk of failure. Using the Vertical Technologies [Extended Maintenance Service](https://www.deltaquad.com/resources/maintenance/) you can extend the lifetime of your vehicle and maintain warranty on the serviced components.

Vehicles flown beyond the recommended maintenance cycles void their warranty.

## Extended Maintenance Service

With the Extended Maintenance Service you can send back your vehicle and we will completely refurbish it. It will be returned as good as new. If the vehicle was damaged beyond repair it can be completely replaced. We offer this service free of any obligation and for a fixed fee. All replaced components are provided with a new warranty.
